  Denali offers a toolkit for creating responsive, mobile-first designs that look and function beautifully on screens of all sizes.

<Heading name="Breakpoints" level="h2" style="h2" type="article" />
Define breakpoints that cater to common device sizes. With Denali you can use prefixes
sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, and 2xl to apply styles at different breakpoints. ```html
<div class="h-48 w-full bg-blue-500 md:w-1/2 lg:w-1/3 2xl:w-1/4"></div>
```

<Heading name="Responsive Typography" level="h3" style="h3" type="article" />
<p>
  Employ scalable text to enhance readability on various devices. Denali is
  built off of Tailwind CSS so you the full range of text utility classes that
  can be combined with breakpoint prefixes for responsive typography.
</p>
<p>
  For a paragraph that changes its line-height and font-size based on the
  device, you can use:
</p>

```html
<p
  class="text-sm leading-normal sm:leading-relaxed md:text-base md:leading-loose lg:text-lg"
>
  This is a responsive paragraph.
</p>
```

<Heading name="Media Queries" level="h3" style="h3" type="article" />
<p>
  Use media queries to apply different styles based on device characteristics.
  Tailwind CSS abstracts media queries into responsive modifiers, making it more
  intuitive to create responsive designs.
</p>
```html
<div class="hidden sm:block">
  This element is hidden on small screens and visible on medium screens and up.
</div>
```

<Heading name="Responsive Images" level="h3" style="h3" type="article" />
<p>
  Implement responsive image techniques to serve appropriate image sizes.
  Tailwind provides utilities for handling image responsiveness.
</p>
<p>To make an image responsive, you can use the max-w- utility:</p>

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Sample" class="h-auto max-w-full" />
```

<Heading name="Testing" level="h3" style="h3" type="article" />
<p>
  Conduct testing on various devices and screen sizes to ensure full coverage.
  Tools like BrowserStack or manual testing across different devices can help
  ensure that your design scales appropriately.
