# Accessibility
<Lead>Inclusivity is not optional; it's a necessity.</Lead>
Our design system is committed to providing a universally accessible user experience. Our responsibility transcends the boundary of visual design, extending into coding practices, UI/UX design, and even documentation. This guide covers the foundational principles and practical suggestions to make our products fully accessible, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA and Section 508 guidelines.


<h3>Structure and Layout</h3>
<h4>Logical Ordering</h4>
Organize content according to its significance to make it easier for users to find what they need.

<h4>Hierarchical Consistency</h4>
Stick to a logical sequence of headings: H1, H2, H3, and so on. Never skip levels for styling convenience.

<h4>Visibility of Content</h4>
Resist the urge to hide crucial information within accordions or tabs. Important content should be immediately visible.

<h3>Textual Considerations</h3>
<h4>Language Clarity</h4>
Choose straightforward language. This enables easier navigation for users who depend on screen readers, and benefits those who speak English as an additional language.

<h4>Text Resizing</h4>
Design UIs to be resilient when text scales or wraps. This is crucial for different languages and magnification levels.

<h3>Navigation and Interactivity</h3>
<h4>Keyboard Usability</h4>
All features must be usable via keyboard alone. This is essential for users who cannot use a mouse.

<h4>Focus Management</h4>
Keep the keyboard focus in a logical order and make the focus indicator obvious.

<h4>Tooltips and Validation</h4>
Tooltips should be keyboard-activated. Inline validation on forms should be easily accessible to keyboard users.

<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<h4>Image Descriptions</h4>
Images should include succinct but informative alt text. Decorative images should use an empty alt="" attribute.

<h4>Video Accessibility</h4>
Include captions and audio descriptions. Ensure controls are accessible to keyboard and screen readers.

<h3>Visual Design</h3>
<h4>Color Choices</h4>
Maintain AA standard contrast ratios. Utilize more cues than color alone to convey information.

<h4>Iconography</h4>
Use icons in conjunction with text or other indicators to ensure their purpose is universally understood.

<h3>Testing and Compliance</h3>
While adhering to these guidelines will contribute significantly to accessibility, it is not a substitute for rigorous testing. Include accessibility tests using a variety of assistive technologies, and, whenever possible, conduct tests with real users who have various impairments.
