Denali leverages the [Tailwind CSS Color Palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) to use in components plus several custom additions, documented below. Like all Tailwind color classes, you can use these custom colors by appending a context to the start of the name, for example, bg-success-base will generate a background color using the success-base color; using text-danger-base and hover:text-danger-focus will use the base and focus versions of the danger color when viewed or hovered on.
