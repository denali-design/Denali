# Inclusive language
<Lead>Guidelines for fostering respectful and equitable communication in every interaction.</Lead>

Inclusive language aims to remove barriers in communication, ensuring that all users can understand and interact with the product effectively, irrespective of their background, gender, culture, or abilities. It's not just a best practiceâ€”it's a necessity in our increasingly diverse society.

Building an accessible and equitable digital experience extends beyond coding practices and visual design. The words we use in the UI significantly affect the experience for all users, including those who use assistive technologies.

<h2>Principles of Inclusive Language</h2>
<h3>Clarity</h3>
Opt for simple, straightforward words and phrases. Language should be easy to understand to make the application accessible to users who speak English as an additional language, or who have cognitive disabilities.

<h3>Consistency</h3>
Use terminology consistently across your app. This consistency aids in learning and removes confusion, especially for screen reader users.

<h3>Sensitivity</h3>
Avoid terms that can marginalize or stigmatize groups of people based on aspects like gender, race, or ability. This also includes avoiding idioms that may not translate well.

<h3>Affirmation</h3>
Choose words that respect and affirm people's identities. This contributes to a more welcoming and inclusive environment.

<h2>Dos and Don'ts</h2>

<DoAndDont direction="horizontal"  doChildren={<p>Use "Save" for a button that commits changes.</p>} 
        dontChildren={<p>Use "Execute" for the same purpose, as it may have a violent connotation.</p>}/>

<DoAndDont direction="horizontal"  doChildren={<p>Use gender-neutral language like "they/them" when the gender of the person is not known or relevant.</p>} 
        dontChildren={<p>Default to using "he/him" as a generic pronoun.</p>}/>

<DoAndDont direction="horizontal"  doChildren={<p>Label a button "Submit Feedback."</p>} 
        dontChildren={<p>Label it "Whistleblow," as it might have a negative or confusing implication.</p>}/>


<h3>Writing Alt Text</h3>
Describe the function or content of an image without stating the obvious. Alt text should provide equal access to the image's information or function. Limit the use of phrases like "image of" or "graphic of" unless necessary for understanding the image.
<DoAndDont direction="horizontal"  doChildren={<p>Company logo"</p>} 
        dontChildren={<p>Image of a company logo</p>}/>

<h2>Complex Content</h2>
For diagrams, infographics, or complex images, provide a textual alternative nearby or a link to a detailed description.

<h3>Videos and Multimedia</h3>
Offer subtitles and a transcript for audio or video content.
Use descriptive captions for any text displayed within the video.

<h3>Validation Messages</h3>
Use language that provides constructive feedback without blaming the user.
<DoAndDont direction="horizontal"  doChildren={<p>Please enter a valid email address.</p>} 
        dontChildren={<p>Invalid input! You failed to enter a correct email.</p>}/>

<h3>Testing Language Accessibility</h3>
Involve diverse focus groups in your testing, including non-native speakers and people with disabilities. Use tools like text analyzers to check readability levels.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Inclusive language in a app is not a one-time task but an ongoing commitment. It's crucial to keep updating and reviewing the language to ensure it remains as inclusive as possible. This requires not just initial implementation but also regular testing and revisions. Always refer to established guidelines such as WCAG 2.1 for the most current best practices.
