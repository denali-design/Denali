# Denali

An accessible, scalable React component library.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run storybook` to preview components

### Storybook

Components are previewed and documented using Storybook. Running `npm run storybook` will create a local web server and display the component docs in your browser.

### Linting

Run `npm run lint` to check components during development.

### Building for Production

Run `npm run build` to build a Vite site using these components.

## Adobe Reactg Aria

This project uses [Adobe React ARIA](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/) as a basis for many of its interactive React components. Refer to the Adobe React ARIA docs for additional props or other information that may not be available in Storybook docs.
